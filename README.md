# Questrade Stock Tracker

Changes:
- no more refreshing the token from questrade, stores new token in text
- simplify reporting of equities, all now reported with no need for user input. 

------
This script is designed to automate the workflow of  tracking stocks currently owned, sold and watching.  Takes advantage of the Questrade API for which an access code must be derived through them

See #Documentation.docx for setup, how to run, dependencies, and future implementations.

I need to generate refresh token each run from Questrade. Not sure why but I have contacted Questrade support but no solution.

Let's collaborate and make this better! Message me
